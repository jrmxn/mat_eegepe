## Introduction

This repository provides a simple MATLAB implementation of [`py_eegepe`](https://github.com/jrmxn/py_eegepe), designed for applying machine learning approaches to causal instantaneous EEG rhythm phase prediction. Please note that this repository has not undergone thorough testing. Use at your own risk. The code is related to (but did not ship with) the following publication:
